# FSJS_Project_8
SQL Library Manager

This project consistes in creating an application for your local library to help them manage their collection of books. The aplication will help to manage the library collections more easily. The aplication allow to ad a new book, edit an existing book entry and delete a book. I add some extra styles to the front page.

For this project I use:
    - VSCode as the IDE
    - Chrome for testing
    - Javascript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and SQL ORM Sequelize
    - DB Browser for SQLite - to open the database and visualize the entries
    
 To start the project just download, type `npm install` for install the dependecies and `npm start`to start the project. Open the browser on `http://localhost:3000/`
